# Analyzing Churn Rates for Telecom Company

Analyzing churn not only means knowing what the churn rate is but also figuring out why customers are churning at the rate they are and how to reduce churn. We will answer these questions by creating calculated fields and various visualizations in Tableau, such as dual-axis graphs and scatter plots. We will make our graphs dynamic by using filters and parameters and combine everything into a story to share our insights.
